# TEA5767-Radio-Module-Prototype

Notes:
  
  -This code is a simplified version of the final product the tests two things
  
    1. If the radio module can recieve signals and covert them to sound
    2. If the radio module can transfer information to the serial terminal 

  -In the final product the data will be sent to a display screen and two servo motors instead of the serial terminal 
  
  -Code adapted from: https://www.instructables.com/How-to-use-the-TEA5767-FM-Radio-module-Arduino-Tut/
