# TEA5767-Radio-Module-Prototype

Important:
  The diagram of the prototype can be found under the tab labelled "Wiki" within this repository

Notes:
  This code is a simplified version of the final product the tests two things
  1. If the radio can recieve signals and covert them to sound
  2. If the radio can transfer information to the serial terminal 

In the final product the data will be sent to a display screen and servo motors instead of the terminal
